  <p>The most common numbers appear in our finances: when <b>shopping or saving</b>.</p>
  <h2 class="h2indent">Shopping</h2>
  <p>Mathematics that occurs in shopping often relates to a budget and different taxes.</p>
  <p>To calculate the <em>net cost</em>, we have different scenarios with the <em>pre-tax</em> cost of the item as
    <b>x</b>:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <ol>
        <li>Our first version is when you only have one tax percentage (call it <b>a%</b>). You can either:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Use a <em>"direct"</em> calculation way shown below</li>
          <dl>
            <dt><em>Net cost =</em> x * (100 - a)%</dt>
            <dd>Thinking process: We subtract a from 100 to have the percentage that remains after subracting
              tax,<br>then we multiply by x with that resulting percentage</dd>
          </dl>
          <li>Or use a <em>"complementary"</em> calculation way that may be slower, shown below</li>
          <dl>
            <dt><em>Net cost =</em> x - (x * a%)</dt>
            <dd>Thinking process: We calculate the tax, then subtract it from x</dd>
          </dl>
        </ol>
        <li>Our second scenario is when you have <b>more than</b> one tax percentage. Suppose we have two taxes:
          <b>b%</b> and
          <b>c%</b>
        </li>
        <dl>
          <dd>Note: The calculations depend on the policies in the shopping area.</dd>
          <dt>Most places have the <em>Net cost =</em> x - [x * (b%)] - [x * (c%)] = x (100 - b - c)%, in which you
            apply
            b and c tax to x</dt>
          <dd>Other places have the <em>Net cost =</em> x * (100 - b)% * (100 - c)%, in which you apply, b tax to x,
            then
            apply c tax to the result after b tax</dd>
          <dt>Note: don't confuse these two as they are totally different cases!</dt>
        </dl>
      </ol>
    </dt>
  </dl>
  <p>After, we compare the <em>net cost</em> and our budget.<br>If the <em>net cost</em> is <b>less than or equal to</b>
    our budget, we can afford it. Otherwise, we can't.</p>
  <h2 class="h2indent">Saving</h2>
  <!--Beginning of saving-->
  <p>When you set aside money <em>(principal amount)</em> in your savings account for a period of time, <br>and if you
    give
    your financial institution permission to use your investment for loans, the institution will pay you back your
    <em>principal
      amount (name it <b>z</b>)</em> plus <em>annual interest (name it <b>d%</b>).</em>
  </p>
  <p>Often, you choose to save for a number of years (name it <b>y</b>) that earns you your desired <em>total
      sum</em>, which can be compared to the <em>total amount</em> you planned to have (your <em>total sum</em> probably
    won't be spot on to
    your <em>total planned amount</em>).<br>We can calculate it two ways as shown below,<br></p>
  <dl>
    <dd>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a <em>"direct"</em> calculation way:</li>
        <dl>
          <dt><em>Total sum =</em> z * (100 + d)% * y</dt>
          <dd>Thinking process: We add a to 100 to have the percentage that is there after adding annual interest,<br>then we
            multiply by y to calculate the percentage of the total after the years of annual interest, which is then multiplied
            by x
            to calculate the total amount.</dd>
        </dl>
        <li>Or use a <em>"complementary"</em> calculation way:</li>
        <dl>
          <dt><em>Total sum =</em> z + (z * d% * y)</dt>
          <dd>Thinking process: We calculate the total annual interest rate considering the number of years and the principal
            amount, then add to the
            principal amount (z) to have the total.</dd>
        </dl>
      </ol>
      <p>After, we compare the <em>total sum to our total planned amount</em>.<br>If the <em>total sum</em> is
        <b>greater
          than or equal to</b>
        our <em>planned total</em>, we are successful. Otherwise, we should invest the money for more years.</p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
